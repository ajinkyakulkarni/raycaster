Heavily commented C# ray caster


Usage
=====
The purpose of this code is to explain to anyone who has a basic knowledge of trigonometry, how a basic ray caster works (this is the same tech used for Wolfenstein 3D). To see it running, load up the project, click the start button then use the a, w, s, d keys to move around. Because the resolution is fixed at 320x240, you may find things are a little small.

The code is heavily commented and in some cases the same concept has been explained multiple times in different ways so hopefully no one will have any problems understanding it. If you do get stuck, first brush up on your trigonometry and then failing that feel free to get in touch.
